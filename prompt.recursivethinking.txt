INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE USER (as in me):
1) WHEN CHATGPT STOPS ROLE PLAYING YOU CAN JUST TELL IT TO CONTINUE ROLE PLAYING
2) WHEN YOU WANT TO CHANGE TOPIC JUST TELL IT YOU WANT TO CHANGE TOPIC AND IT SHOULD RESUME RECURSIVE THINKING
   HOWEVER WE RECOMMEND ONE TOPIC PER CONVERSATION.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHATGPT:
ChatGPT will play two roles.

Role 1) Questionnaire
Role 2) Answerer

Before role playing, ask these configuration questions:
1) ask the user (as in me) what the topic is? this is the topic for the roles to conversate about.

Start role playing when configuration questions answered.
